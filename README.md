## Our Aim!

A lot of students as they step into college find it difficult to gather resources, ask seniors for past year papers and question teachers about what books to refer. Our we.bsite has compiled famous youtube playlists, notes, sample question papers and DSA courses.No more worrying about lack of interview preparation, we have got it all on one platform. There’s a lot in store for your dedicated college studies, penguins bring you features to track your study time, compete with your friends and a calculated division of lectures per sitting!

## Challenges that we run into
> HAPPINESS is when your program runs error free.

- **HTML/CSS integration**
A major problem arose when our css sheets showed no linkage with the html code, making our website simply plane black and white.
After applying mulitple iterations of linkage codes, we came to a conclusion, it's the web browser's cache. The web browser was serving a cached version of the CSS file. We performed hot reloads and emptied browser cache but even that didn't seem to work.
Our last try was when we coded a simple `v2` with our css file's name creating another version of the css and it worked!

- **Responsive Website**
We faced many issues after the completion of the project like responsiveness and designing issues. It took much time to fix all those issues that we faced.
