A solution to all your academic college challenges lies here. Compiled notes and lectures from your senior’s registers straight into your own devices. 

# Challenges that we run into
> HAPPINESS is when your program runs error free.

- **HTML/CSS integration**
A major problem arose when our css sheets showed no linkage with the html code, making our website simply plane black and white.
After applying mulitple iterations of linkage codes, we came to a conclusion, it's the web browser's cache. The web browser was serving a cached version of the CSS file. We performed hot reloads and emptied browser cache but even that didn't seem to work.
Our last try was when we coded a simple `v2` with our css file's name creating another version of the css and it worked!

- **Responsive Website**
We faced many issues after the completion of the project like responsiveness and designing issues. It took much time to fix all those issues that we faced.

# Our learning from this project-
* We learnt to work in a team
* We learnt many new concepts that we never used before
